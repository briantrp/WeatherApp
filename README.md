# 🌤️ WeatherApp

A small test project to learn **HTML** and **CSS** – with the goal of displaying the **current weather** in a visually appealing way.

## 🎯 Purpose

This app is part of my journey into **web development**, focusing on:
- Structuring content using **HTML**
- Designing the layout with **CSS**
- Creating a clean and simple user interface for weather information

## ⚙️ Features

- Display of current weather (e.g., temperature, condition, location)
- Responsive and beginner-friendly design
- Built using only HTML and CSS – no JavaScript (yet 😉)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 📸 Screenshot

*(Add a screenshot of your app here once it's ready!)*

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add real-time weather data using an API (with JavaScript)
- Improve styling and add animations
- Allow location-based weather lookup

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understand the basics of semantic HTML
- Practice CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid, etc.)
- Build a small but complete mini-project
